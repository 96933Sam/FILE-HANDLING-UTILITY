TASK DESCRIPTION: This Java project demonstrates basic file operations such as reading, writing, and modifying text files. The program allows users to choose between three file operations: reading the contents of a file, writing new content to a file, or appending content to an existing file. The file operations are implemented using Java’s built-in file handling classes such as BufferedReader, BufferedWriter, and FileReader.

The project is designed to be interactive, with the user specifying the file name and selecting the operation they want to perform. This makes it a great starting point for anyone learning file handling in Java. The program is capable of reading and displaying file content, writing content to files, and appending new content to existing files.

Features Read File: Displays the content of a specified file to the console. Write File: Writes the content provided by the user to a specified file. If the file doesn’t exist, it is created. Modify File: Appends new content to an existing file, adding the new content on a new line.
